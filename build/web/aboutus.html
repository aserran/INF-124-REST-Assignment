						<br></br>Cool Fitted is your newest and best way to shop the latest
						and freshest headwear out. The company was started by two
						young Software Engineering students from the University of California,
						Irvine. Both founders began this project like any other but soon realized
						that it could be much bigger. On April 20, 2017, they launched their first
						beta site for the company, with one goal in mind. That goal being to provide
						a fast and easy way for hat connoisseurs to stay cool fitted.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Cool Fitted philosophy is one and only. We are committed to provide direct
						access to the latest and coolest headpieces. The company in its entirety is
						committed to give each of our customers an excellent service and experience
						which in turn encourages their interest to come back. Our cool hat algorithm is
						our keystone in distinguishing ourselves from the rest. We only focus on the
						headwear that is popular, cool, and in stock. Our algorithm filters down the
						recent headwear drops to only provide those that will interest the customer more.
						It gets rid of the cumbersome, endless amount of pages of dull and poor quality hats
						that other sites do. While we may not boast an enormous inventory, we pay personal
						attention to what we do have in order to ensure that what we are selling is worth it.
						Each piece in our inventory is guaranteed to sell and please our customers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Cool Fitted headwear stock consists of a vibrant mixture of different styles
						and brands. From Snapbacks to Dad hats, Cool Fitted will always have something
						for you. The buying process is easy; you just browse and click on hats to add to
						your cart. There is no sign up required, just enter your billing information and you
						will receive your products within 2-business days. The Cool Fitted site is in continuous
						fluctuation due to the limited stock of fresh headwear. We constantly update our products
						in order to keep you up to date with the newest headwear drops.
					</p>
					<p>
						Cool Fitted is still a relatively new company but has seen steady growth since
						its initial stages. Although in its infancy, CoolFitted has already become one of
						the most popular headwear companies in the United States.
